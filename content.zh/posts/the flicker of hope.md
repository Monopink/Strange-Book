The sun sets low, the day is done,
A quiet hush, the world's undone.
But in the stillness, there's a spark,
A glimmer bright, a shining mark.

For though the night may seem so long,
And darkness looms, so fierce and strong,
There's hope that flickers, like a flame,
And guides us through, when all's the same.

So hold on tight, and don't let go,
For soon enough, the light will show.
And in that moment, we'll be free,
To chase our dreams, and destiny.
